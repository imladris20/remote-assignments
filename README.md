### Assignment 2: RWD Page Layout in pure HTML/CSS
Deployed Website: https://caringtaiwan.netlify.app/

Apply any HTML, CSS techniques without Bootstrap, jQuery or other libraries to accomplish
following RWD page layout requests.

Basic Principle: your layout width should never exceed screen width in all the sizes of
devices. You can use Chrome Device Mode to get quick layout tests.

width is much larger than 1200px.

#### Request 2: Layout when screen width >= 800px and < 1200px
Key Point:
1. Total width of content boxes should scale automatically with screen width.

#### Request 3: Layout when screen width >= 500px and < 800px
Key Point:
1. Menu Items in the navigator should be replaced by a menu trigger icon.
